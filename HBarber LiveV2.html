    <h2>Trader Turned Coder</h2>
    <p>Professional investor/trader using code to generate better trades.  My motto is "better investments through better coding".  The trading landscape is drastically changing.  Technology is quickly replacing the traditional trader.  But, I am combining the human trading acumen with code to create the "Ultimate Trader".    </p>

      <li>Learns techniques, not tools</li>
      <li>Learns several languages</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>History</h2>
  I started trading U.S. stocks in 1992.  For the next five years I honed my skills trading small, mid, and large-cap U.S. equities.  Most of the trading was single stock orders that I would call in to a broker.  In 1997 I went to work for a pension that managed over $100bn in assets.  As a global trader I traded in the markets all around the world.  I became proficient at understanding the different trading rules, market action, market participants, liquidity, and nuances in the different markets.  I also started trading the foreign currency in all those markets.  During this time the transition to technological based trading was just starting to gain ground.  Electronic trading allowed me to execute several multi-billion dollar portfolio transitions.  I started to become aware of the power that technology was going to have in the future of trading and the financial industry as a whole.

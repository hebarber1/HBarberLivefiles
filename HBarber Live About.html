    <h1>Herman Barber - Professional Investor and Coder</h1>
    <h2>Trader Turned Coder</h2>
    <p>Professional investor/trader using code to generate better trades.  My motto is "better investments through better coding".  The trading landscape is drastically changing.  Technology is quickly replacing the traditional trader.  But, I am combining the human trading acumen with code to create the "Ultimate Trader".    </p>

<h2>About Herman</h2>

<p> Herman is originally from Topeka, Kansas.  Herman became interested in the markets when his dad started teaching him how to read the ticker tape.  After receiving his B.A. Herman started working as a stock trader for a mutual fund company.  During his 5 year tenure with that company Herman started to hone his trading acumen.  During that time trading was done primarily over the phone.  There was a new system called Instinet that allowed institutional traders to execute trades electronically with each other.  This was Herman's first exposure to electronic trading.  Herman went to work as a global trader for a $110bn pension fund.  Herman executed equity and foreign exchange transactions for the firm.  During this time period electronic trading started to evolve.  Herman was instrumental in the acquisition and implementation of several equity and currency electronic trading platforms.  Herman left the pension fund to work for a asset management firm in Los Angeles where he gained knowledge of trading options and futures contracts.  In 2008 Herman was offered the opportunity to move to London and become the Co-CEO of a brokerage firm.  It was in London that Herman was able to use his MBA and trading knowledge to boost revenue, cut costs, and generate a international prescence for the firm.  Herman was responsible for overseeing all operations of the London office.  Within the first year commissions quadrupled from Herman's strategic planning and trading capabilities.  Herman moved back to the U.S. and continues to evolve as a trader and now as a trader/coder.
